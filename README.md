# pyCE
A library for projects related to Configurational Entropy. Written with python 2.7, so compatibility issues exist for python 3.x.

Oscillon module:
Solves the Klein Gordon equation in flat spacetime for spherically symmetric profiles in a symmetric double well potential. Uses the numerical scheme from arXiv:hep-ph/0110065v2. 

Bubbles Module:
Solves the Euclidean Klein Gordon equation to get instanton profiles.

Cosmology Module:
(UPDATE)
